# Weight Tracker

An offline first app for tracking weight, sleep, and waist.

From a code perspective it is interesting since it is a multi-page application (MPA)
that runs 100% on the [front end in a service
worker](https://github.com/jon49/WeightTracker/tree/master/WeightTracker/FrontEnd).
This makes the code extremely simple except for a library for streaming the html from
the service worker.

There are little JavaScript snippets made on the front end which makes the app a little
more user friendly.

The app can be found for free and without even logging in at <https://weight.jnyman.com/web/>.
Note that logging in will make it so you can back up your data.
